# statewise-election-results

I created a simple program using BeautifulSoup to check the election results in a few states and check Trump's lead in those states. It only prints the lead value when it changes.

I wanted to check only Georgia and Pennsylvania, so I have only included those. To check other states, just change the state name in the URL.
